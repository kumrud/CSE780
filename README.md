# CSE780
McMaster University Data Science course Stats 780/CSE 780 for graduate studies.
The purpose of this project is to revisit to requirements of CSE 780; 6 projects in total while using 6 different statistical theories. 
The advise of the instructor was to write code in R and write data analysis reports in Latex without exceeding the 2 pages limit for 5 projects (report limit was what I found to be the most challenging).

Since the students were discouraged from using Python for data analysis, the question I want to answer is *"What is the difference between R and Python from a data science perspective?"*. My plan is to rewrite all R code in Python, compare the results, and learn more along the way.

## Installation
Setup of the environment and required packages.

### conda environment
```bash
$ conda create -n cse780 python=3.7
```

To activate/deactivate the environment:

```bash
$ conda activate cse780
(cse780) $ conda deactivate
```

install R packages 

```bash
(cse780) $ conda install -c r r-cardata
```
 
 install Python packages

```bash
(cse780) $ conda install -c anaconda pandas
(cse780) $ conda install -c anaconda seaborn
```

Plesase do not use this repository to promote plagiarism. Do not use these reports as your assignments, my advise is to learn by attending the courses and putting elbow grease in to writing the code and reports yourself. When you get stuck everything you need can be found online, use whatever tools you feel the most comfortable i.e. Latex was not first choice so I used Word and it saved me a lot of time.
