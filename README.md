# CSE780
Data Science Assignments for the course Stats 780/CSE 780 on Winter 2019 McMaster University.
The purpose of this project is to revisit to requirements of CSE 780; 5 assignments and 1 final project. The advise of the instructor is to write code in R and reports in Latex. The most challenging past is to not exceed 2 pages for each assignment. My plan is to analyze the data, re-write R code and the reports. Since the students were discouraged from using Python for data analysis. Naturally, the question I want to answer is:
*Why not Python?*

## conda environment
```bash
$ conda create -n cse780 python=3.7
```

To activate/deactivate the environment:

```bash
$ conda activate cse780
(cse780) $ conda deactivate
$
```

install R packages 

```bash
(cse780) $ conda install -c r r-cardata
$
```


Plesase do not use this repository to promote plagiarism. Do not use these reports as your assignments, my advise is to learn by attending the courses and putting elbow grease in to writing the code and reports yourself. When you get stuck everything you need can be found online, use whatever tools you feel the most comfortable i.e. Latex was not first choice so I used Word and it saved me a lot of time.
